      <p>
        Mengyao works with digital painting, character design, and character-based storytelling.
        She is interested in how pictures and simple movement can tell stories. For her, trying
        different media—such as digital tools, oil painting, watercolor, and mixed materials—is
        a way to explore new methods of visual storytelling. Each medium creates a different
        feeling and guides viewers in different ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moving from China to the United States shaped how Mengyao thinks about communication,
        belonging, and change. She is naturally shy, so art became a language she trusts.
        Through painting, she can express emotions that are difficult to say out loud.
      </p>

      <p>
        In her recent work, Mengyao focuses on characters and worldbuilding. Small details—like
        a character’s expression, gesture, or the light in a scene—can show deeper ideas about
        emotion and identity. She enjoys creating moments where characters seem to come alive,
        whether through illustration, manga, or short animations, as if they are part of a larger
        growing world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Across most of her work, Mengyao aims to create emotional connection. Instead of making
        images that stand alone, she builds scenes and worlds that invite viewers in. For her, art
        is both a way to keep her own memories and a way to share new stories with others—stories
        filled with quiet feelings, imagination, and gentle transformation.
